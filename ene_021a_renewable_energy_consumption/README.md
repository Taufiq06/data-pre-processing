## Renewable Energy Consumption Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) dataset](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/sustainable-energy-all) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/ene021a-Renewable-Energy-Consumption).

This dataset came in with a csv and was subsetted to have only renewable energy consumption data. The table was converted from wide to a long form, using Python. Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/blob/master/ene_021a_renewable_energy_consumption/ene_021a_renewable_energy_consumption.py) for more details on this pre-processing.

You can view the processed Global Hunger Index dataset for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/ene021a-Renewable-Energy-Consumption).

You can also download original dataset [directly through Resource Watch](http://wri-public-data.s3.amazonaws.com/resourcewatch/ene_021a_renewable_energy_consumption.zip).

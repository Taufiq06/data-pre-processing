## This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to create the dataset Access to Electricity (National), Access to Electricity (Urban), and Access to Electricity (Rural)

The original dataset is a zipped file with three csv files for urban, rural and total population from 1990 to 2017. The name of the three files are: API_EG.ELC.ACCS.UR.ZS_DS2_en_csv_v2_52420.csv , API_EG.ELC.ACCS.RU.ZS_DS2_en_csv_v2_45772.csv , API_EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS_DS2_en_csv_v2_126505.csv. We first compile data into one single csv file with columns broken down by region and year. For example, urban_1990, urban 1991, rural_1992, total_1993. Country name and country code columns are retained. We then added a column named year and organized the data according to three columns: urban, rural and total.

This dataset is preprocessed by Tina Huang and QC'ed by XXX

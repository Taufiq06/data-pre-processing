## Female & Male Population Densities Dataset Pre-processing
This file describes the data pre-processing that was done to [the Gridded Population of the World (GPW), v4: Basic Demographic Characteristics, v4.10 (2010)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-basic-demographic-characteristics-rev11) for [display on Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/soc075-Broad-Age-Groups).

The original data contains two layers, male population density and female population density in people per square kilometer.

To create the layer "Number of females per 100 males", we divide the female population density by the male population density and then multiply by 100.

This calculation was done using Google Earth Engine, a free geospatial analysis system by Google. While the sytem is free you need to sign up with a Google account, which can be done [here](https://earthengine.google.com/). 

The code used to preprocess this layer in Google Earth Engine can be found [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/69705398b91fdcbdad2298f08ada5da4) and is copied below.
```
var female = ee.Image('projects/resource-watch-gee/soc_075_female_male_populations/female_density')
var male = ee.Image('projects/resource-watch-gee/soc_075_female_male_populations/male_density')

var scale = female.projection().nominalScale().getInfo()

var m_f_ratio = male.divide(female).multiply(100)

Export.image.toAsset({
  image: m_f_ratio,  
  description: 'Male_Female_Ratio',  
  assetId: 'projects/resource-watch-gee/soc_075_female_male_populations/male_female_ratio_density', 
  scale: scale, 
  maxPixels:1e13})
```
